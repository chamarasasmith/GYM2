            <h1>Aerobics</h1>
            <p>
                Aerobics is a form of physical exercise that combines rhythmic aerobic exercise 
                with stretching and strength training routines with the goal of improving all 
                elements of fitness (flexibility, muscular strength, and cardio-vascular fitness). 
                It is usually performed to music and may be practiced in a group setting led by an
                instructor (fitness professional), although it can be done solo and without musical 
                accompaniment. With the goal of preventing illness and promoting physical fitness, 
                practitioners perform various routines comprising a number of different dance-like 
                exercises. Formal aerobics classes are divided into different levels of intensity 
                and complexity. A well-balanced aerobics class will have five components: warm-up 
                (5–10 minutes), cardio vascular conditioning (25–30 minutes), muscular strength and 
                conditioning (10–15 minutes), cool-down (5–8 minutes) and stretching and flexibility 
                (5–8 minutes). Aerobics classes may allow participants to select their level of 
                participation according to their fitness level. Many gyms offer a variety of aerobic 
                classes. Each class is designed for a certain level of experience and taught by a 
                certified instructor with a specialty area related to their particular class.
