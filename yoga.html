                <h1>Yoga</h1>
                <p>Derived from the Sanskrit word yuj, Yoga means union of the individual consciousness or soul 
                    with the Universal Consciousness or Spirit. Yoga is a 5000-year-old Indian body of knowledge. 
                    Though many think of yoga only as a physical exercise where people twist, turn, stretch, and 
                    breathe in the most complex ways, these are actually only the most superficial aspect of this 
                    profound science of unfolding the infinite potentials of the human mind and soul. The science 
                    of Yoga imbibes the complete essence of the Way of Life.
