            <p>
                Bodybuilding is the use of progressive resistance exercise to control and develop one's musculature.
                An individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a bodybuilder. In professional bodybuilding,
                bodybuilders appear in lineups and perform specified poses (and later individual posing routines) for a 
                panel of judges who rank the competitors based on criteria such as symmetry, muscularity, and conditioning.
                Bodybuilders prepare for competitions through a combination of intentional dehydration, elimination of 
                nonessential body fat, and carbohydrate loading to achieve maximum vascularity, as well as tanning to 
                accentuate muscular definition.
