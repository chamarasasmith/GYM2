                    Bodybuilding is the use of progressive resistance exercise to control and develop one's 
                    musculature. An individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a bodybuilder. 
                    In professional bodybuilding, bodybuilders appear in lineups and perform specified poses 
                    (and later individual posing routines) for a panel of judges who rank the competitors based 
                    on criteria such as symmetry, muscularity, and conditioning.

                    Aerobics is a form of physical exercise that combines rhythmic aerobic exercise 
                    with stretching and strength training routines with the goal of improving all 
                    elements of fitness (flexibility, muscular strength, and cardio-vascular fitness). 
                    It is usually performed to music and may be practiced in a group setting led by an 
                    instructor (fitness professional), although it can be done solo and without musical 
                    accompaniment.

                    Derived from the Sanskrit word yuj, Yoga means union of the individual consciousness 
                    or soul with the Universal Consciousness or Spirit. Yoga is a 5000-year-old Indian 
                    body of knowledge. Though many think of yoga only as a physical exercise where people 
                    twist, turn, stretch, and breathe in the most complex ways, these are actually only 
                    the most superficial aspect of this profound science of unfolding the infinite potentials
